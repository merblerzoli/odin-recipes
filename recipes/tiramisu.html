    <h2> Description</h2>

    <p> Tiramisu is an elegant and rich Italian dessert that requires no baking.
        It is made by layering crisp ladyfingers dipped in strong espresso coffee.
        These layers are alternated with a <em>sweetened, creamy mixture of mascarpone cheese and eggs.</em>
        The dessert is finished with a generous dusting of cocoa powder for a touch of bitterness.
        It is <strong>best served chilled </strong>, allowing the flavors to meld together perfectly.</p>
