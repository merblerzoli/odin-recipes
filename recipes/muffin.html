    <h2> Description</h2>

    <p> A muffin is a small, individual quick bread, baked in cup-shaped pans,
        known for its moist, dense, crumbly texture and typically sweet flavor,
        though savory versions exist. They're leavened with baking powder/soda, unlike yeast-risen breads,
        often feature mix-ins like berries or chocolate chips, and differ from cupcakes by having a less-beaten batter,
        coarser texture, and generally no icing, serving as versatile breakfast, snack, or dessert items. </p>
